# Game-of-Life
Draws cells in a 1 or 2 dimensional Game of Life

The function draw_cells is meant to be used in conjunction
with the textbook module stddraw. The caller should call

stddraw.show()

after calling draw_cells; however, this causes the program
to enter the Pygame event loop. See the example programs:

glider_life2.py
gosper_gun2.py
random_life2.py

to see how to close the Pygame window.
